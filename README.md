To run this code, you’ll need to have PHP installed on your computer. You can download it from the official PHP website.
You’ll also need to install Composer to manage dependencies.
Once you have PHP and Composer installed, navigate to the directory where you cloned your repository and run composer install to install the required dependencies.
You’ll also need to create a credentials.json file with your Google API credentials and place it in the same directory as your code.
Finally, start a local PHP server by running php -S localhost:8000 in the command line from the directory where your code is located.
Open a web browser and navigate to http://localhost:8000 to view and interact with your code.
